/**
 * The aplexer session manager — shared identity, wire shape, and join command.
 *
 * aplexer (`a`) is the MAIN session manager on hosts that have it; raw tmux
 * (via the `pocketshell` helper and `tmuxctl`) is the fallback for hosts that
 * do not. The two models are deliberately different shapes — tmux names one
 * flat global namespace, aplexer addresses `workspace + tag` with an immutable
 * UUID underneath — so this module is the one place that translates between
 * them.
 *
 * This file is renderer-safe: pure types and string builders only, no Node,
 * no ssh2. The exec-level client lives in main (`helper/AplexerClient.ts`)
 * and the JSON parsing in `helper/aplexerParsers.ts`.
